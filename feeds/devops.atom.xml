&lt;p&gt;The development side of things has more to do with the actual code needed for a project rather than making the product operational. These are the people who write the code and set up the structure/foundation for the product or application they are producing. If the development team does not complete their work effciently, then the operations team cannot get the product/application up and running this role in a company normally consists of software engineers which requires a degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="devops"></category></entry></feed>
