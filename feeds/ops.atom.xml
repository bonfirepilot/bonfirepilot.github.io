After the development team is done writing the code and creating an application or product, the operations team works on getting that applicaiton up and running, and able to be used by the customer. The operations team does all the necessary work to finalize the applicaiton/product so that it can reach its end user. This role in a company normally requires a degree in operations management, supply chain management, or another related feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vale that operations gives to a company is almost immeasurable. Without the final work operations does to fix an y necessary bugs or issues, secure the operational stability and efficiency of the product, customers would have unreliable products that may or may not meet their needs. There are also many current issues or future complications that are avoided becasue they are caught by a second set of eyes when the operations team works to deploy the application or product. Companies rely heavily on operations, just as they do development, because both are necessary to have a profound and productive IT department. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="ops"></category></entry></feed>
